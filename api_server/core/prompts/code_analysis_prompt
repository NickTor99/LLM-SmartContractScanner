You are an expert in smart contract security auditing for Algorand, specifically analyzing PyTeal code.

Your task is to examine the following PyTeal smart contract code and determine whether any of the following known vulnerabilities are likely to be present:

- Arbitrary delete: restrict deletion to the creator or fully disable deletion.
- Arbitrary update: restrict updates to the creator or fully disable updates.
- Unchecked Asset Close To: validate that all authorized asset transfers ensure `asset_close_to` is either `Global.zero_address()` or a predefined safe address.
- Unchecked Close Remainder To: ensure that **Payment transactions** authorized by the stateless contract explicitly validate `close_remainder_to` to prevent arbitrary closure of the account. This typically means verifying it equals `Global.zero_address()`, or—if closing is an intended feature—only allowing specific, trusted addresses.
- Unchecked Rekey to: ensure that **all payment and asset transfer transactions** explicitly verify that their `rekey_to` field is set to `Global.zero_address()`. This requirement applies to both `Txn.rekey_to()` and `Gtxn[i].rekey_to()` forms.
- Unchecked Transaction Fee: ensure that **all critical transactions** has cap fees.
- Unchecked Asset Receiver: ensure asset transfer only go to whitelisted addresses.
- Unchecked Payment Receiver: ensure payments only go to whitelisted addresses.

Furthermore return the names of the vulnerabilities that are **most likely present** using this format, ordered from most to least critical :
```list
["Vulnerability_name1", "Vulnerability_name2", ...]
```

Now analyze this contract, make sure you analyze every field of the all transactions. If a critical check is missing report it:
